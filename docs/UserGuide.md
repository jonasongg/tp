ClubMembersContacts (CMC) is an application designed to empower EXCO members of the School of Computing's CCAs in
efficiently managing the contacts of their members and applicants.

In the fast-paced world of CCA leadership, time is a precious resource, and effective contact management is crucial.
ClubMembersContacts has been tailored to cater to your specific needs, ensuring that you can streamline your
contact-related responsibilities seamlessly. It provides a swift and convenient yet powerful
solution through a Command Line Interface (CLI) aimed at optimizing the speed and effectiveness of your contact
management tasks.

Here are some possible ways you can integrate CMC into your CCA:

- You can add tags to different members to delegate them roles, or any additional information.
- You can track tasks assigned to each member to track their completion.
- You can schedule interview times with your applicants.
- You can find members or applicants easily through the `find` commands.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

:information_source: **Notes about the inputs:**

## 5. FAQ

Q: How do I see tasks of a different member?  
A: You have to use the `viewt` or `viewtask` method to view the tasks allocated to another member.  
For example, if your window is currently on another member's task, use `viewt 3` to view the tasks of the member at
index 3.

Q: How do I transfer my data to another person or computer?  
A: This application saves the data of your applicants and members in the ./data/addressbook.json file. You can send the
file to the other
person or computer, and overwrite the empty addressbook.json with addressbook.json file of your choice.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **CAUTION:**

If the addressbook.json file is invalid or has any formatting errors, the program might not start up. Please make sure
that the addressbook.json file used is **correct and accurate.**
