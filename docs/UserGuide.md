ClubMembersContacts (CMC) is an application designed to empower EXCO members of the School of Computing's CCAs in
efficiently managing the contacts of their members and applicants.

In the fast-paced world of CCA leadership, time is a precious resource, and effective contact management is crucial.

- You can track tasks assigned to each member to track their completion.
- You can schedule interview times with your applicants.
- You can find members or applicants easily through the `find` commands.

:information_source: **Notes about the inputs:**

  For example, in `addm /name NAME`, `NAME` would be the input parameter for the member's name.

* Fields in square brackets `[ ]` are optional fields.

* Parameters can be in any order.  
  For example, `adda /name Taylor Swift /phone 91961969` and `adda /phone 91691969 /name Taylor Swift` will result in

index 3.

A: This application saves the data of your applicants and members in the ./data/addressbook.json file. You can send the
file to the other
person or computer, and overwrite the empty addressbook.json with addressbook.json file of your choice.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **CAUTION:**
